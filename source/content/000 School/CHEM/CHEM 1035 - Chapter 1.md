*Chemistry is the scientific study of matter and its properties, the changes that matter undergoes, and the energy associated with those changes.*

## 1. States of Matter and its Properties

### 1.1 The Three States

Each state is defined by its relative position of its atoms

1. Solid
2. Liquid
3. Gas

#### 1.2 Properties of Matter

##### 1.2.1 Physical Change

This means composition does not change, only the physical properties of od the substance changes

##### 1.2.2 Physical Properties

*Those which the substance shows by itself without interacting with another substance such as color, melting point, boiling point, density*

**Intensive Properties**
- Independent of amount of substance
- Can be used to characterize matter

**Temperature Scales and Interconversions**

1. Fahrenheit
2. Celsius 
3. Kelvin

T (in F) = 9/5T (in C) +32
T (in C) = (T (in F) - 32) * 5/9


##### 1.2.3 Chemical Change 

This means it changes or interacts with another substance

i.e flammability, etc.

### 2. Central Theme of Chem 

*We study **observable** changes in matter to understand their **unobservable** causes*

## 2. Scientific Method

Im going to fill this later this is stuff I already know 

### 2.1 Observation 

### 2.2 Hypothesis

### 2.3 Experiment 

### 2.4 Model 

## 3. Units

### 3.1 SI Units

## 4. Precision vs Accuracy
![[Pasted image 20230825103229.png]]

### 4.1 Precision

**Precision**: Indication of how close the measurements are to each other

Precision is affected by **Random Error**, which is always present. These can be due to something like quality of the measuring tool and variability of the sample

### 4.2 Accuracy 

**Accuracy**: Indication of how close the measurements are to the true value

Accuracy is affected by **Systematic Error**. This error is part of the experimental system.
