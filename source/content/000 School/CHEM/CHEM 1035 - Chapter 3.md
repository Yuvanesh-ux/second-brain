## 1.1 Mole

**Stoichiometry**: Mole-Mass-Number relationships in chemical systems

**Mole**: is the amount of a substance that contains the same number of entities as there are atoms in exactly 12g of carbon-12

### 1.1.1 Molar Mass

**The molar mass** of a substance is the mass of a mole of its entities (atoms, molecules, or formula units)

The mass in atoms mass unites (a m u) of one atom is of an element or one molecule or formula unit of compound **is the same numerically** as the mass in grams of 1 mole of the substance
