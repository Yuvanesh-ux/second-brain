## 1. Covalent Compound

Covalent compounds are non-electrolytes

When dissolved in water, covalent compound do not ionize (break apart)

## 1.1 Acids and their covalent properties

When acids are dissolved in water, they break up into hydrogen and its ions

HCl -> H<sup>+</sup>+ Cl<sup>-</sup>

<center><b>Acids can be fully or partially dissolved</b></center>

## 2.Type of equations

### 2.1 Molecular Equation
- When attractive forces between sions in an ion compound are not as as the attractive forces between the ions and water, the compound dissolves

- Two soluble ionic react to give an insoluble product, called a **precipitate**

- Characterized by ionic solutions, combing to form heterogenous mixture 

- The precipitate forms through the net removal of ions form solution

- It is possible for mo

### 2.2 Total Ionic Equation

If it's a strong electrolyte, it shows all dissociated ions as an equation

### 2.3 Spectator Ions
Ions that are not involved in the actual chemical change
