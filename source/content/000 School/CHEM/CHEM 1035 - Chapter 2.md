# THE COMPONENTS OF MATTER

> **Law of Definite Composition** 
> No matter what its source, a particular compound is composed of the same elements in the same parts (fractions) by mass

> **Law of Multiple Proportions**
> If elements A and B react to form two compounds, the different masses of B that combine with a fixed mass of A can be expressed as a ratio of small whole compounds

## 1. Mixtures 

Mixture is a group of two or more elements and/or compounds that are physically intermingled
### 1.1 Homogeneous

Has one or more cisible boundaries between the components

- A homogenous mixtures is also called a **solution**
- 

### 1.2 Heterogenous

has no visible boundaries because the components are mied as individual atoms, ions, and/or molecules

## 2. Pure substance

### 2.1 Elements

This is the simplest type of of substance. It **cannot** be broken down into any simpler substances by physical or chemical means

- All elements are found on the periodic table, and elements consists of only one type of atom

#### 2.1.1 Molecule

A structure that consists of two or more atoms that are chemically bound together. 

### 2.2 Compounds 

A substance composed of two or more elements that are chemically combined

- Compounds are are composed of molecules
- Composition is fixed
- Properties of components are lost. So components cannot be separated by physical means

#### 2.2.1 Types of Compounds 

##### 2.2.1.1 Ionic Compounds:
A compounds consisting of a cation and an anion (typically a metal and a non-metal)

**Cations** are typically metal and are positive because the metal has lost a few electrons

**Anions** are typically non-metals and are negative because the non-metal gains a few electron

**Ionic Charges of Main Group Monoatomic Ions**

| Cations 	|    	| Anions   	|    	|
|---------	|----	|----------	|----	|
| Group 1 	| 1+ 	| Group 15 	| 3- 	|
| Group   	| 2+ 	| Group 16 	| 2- 	|
| Al      	| 3+ 	| Group 17 	| 1- 	|
| Ag      	| 1+ 	| Group 18 	| 0  	|
| Zn, Cd  	| 2+ 	|          	|    	|

**Common Polyatomic Ions** (Must MEMORIZE)

**Writing Ionic Compounds**

Examples:

(a) Na and Br

We know that Na is 1<sup>+</sup> and Br is 1<sup>-</sup>, so NaBr is the ionic compound

(b) Ammonium and Carbonate

NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and CO3 <sup>2- </sup>, We need 2 NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> to balance the CO<sub>3</sub> <sup>2- </sup>

(c) Mg and P

We know that Mg is 2+ and P is 3-, so to balance them the compounds would be Mg<sub>3</sub>P<sub>2</sub>

**Naming Ionic Compounds**

##### 2.2.1.2 Covalent Compounds:

Covalent compounds are usually compounds between nonmetals

**Naming Binary Covalent Compounds**
- Use Prefixes to indicate the number of atoms of each element
- Mono is usually dropped from the first element
- Add -ide suffix

**Acids**
Acids are a special type of covalent compounds that exists as molecules un the as phase but breaks up into H<sup>+</sup> and an anion when dissolved in water

**A. Binary Acid: H and a nonmental ekement (example: HBr)**

Binary acids are named as follows:

Hydro + nonmetal root + ic + â€“acid (as a separate word)  

**B. Oxoacid: H + Oxoanion**
Oxoacid are named like oxoanions except for two suffix changes

-ate in the oxoanion is changed to -ic

-ite in the oxoanion is change to -ous 


## 3. Periodic Table

***18 columns and 7 rows***

Elements are arrange in the periodic table which organizes the elements so that those with similar properties are in the same column

*Each column of the periodic table is referred to as **group***

*Each row of the periodic table is referred to as a **period***

### 3.1 Metals

**Properties:**
- Conduct electricity
- Malleable and ductile
- Have luster
- mostly solids

#### 3.1.1 Types of Metals
1. Main group Metals

2. Transition Metals

3. Inner Transition Metals
### 3.2 Non Metals

#### 3.2.1 Metalloids

**Properties:**
- Act like non-metals but look like metals

#### 3.2.2 Non-Metals

**Properties:**
- Do not conduct electricity
- Not Malleable nor ductile
- no luster
- mostly gases
