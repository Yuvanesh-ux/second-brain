### 1. The Switch from Hunter-Gatherers to the Modern Life

##### 1.1 The fundamental differences 

Hunter-gatherers relied solely on themselves and their environment to live. To the heavy contrast of today's society where we go to work for money to acquire the things we want

**To a life of few possessions -> A life defined by your possesions**

##### 1.2 Design Appreciation

Design Appreciation is the final design decision that the consumer makes. 

i.e When buying a cotton shirt, you are only respobile for the purchase of the product. However, someone had to plant the cotton, pick it, weave it, cut it, style it etc before you could buy it

This class, Design Appreciation, is not fully about the aesthetic of design but more about **grasping the full implications of—design in our lives.** 

##### 1.3 Trade-offs

Should I pick a house downtown because its cool but has an hour of traffic to work and less space? Should i pick the F-150 because it looks cool or the Tesla Model 3 because it's faster?

Start questioning the more base level questions. i.e for the car “Do I really need a car?” If the answer is yes, the next question is “Why do I need a car?”

##### 1.4 Climate Change as a Design Problem

Climate change is a design problem accumulated out of the millions of other design decisions in our lives. Just the simple act of buying a t-shirt has the gajillion steps behind that cause CO2 emissions
