## 1. AgriCULTURE

### 1.1 The Origins

Intentionally growing crops for food started ~12,000 yrs ago

The exact reason to why Agriculture and settling down emerged is still debated, some believe as population increased, the availability of food for hunting and gathering couldn’t meet demand, so people had to grow their own food.

### 1.2 the Culture in Agri

Up until the 1700s agriculture used to take up 1/3 of the entire England workforce, and 2/3s of France. 

But today, **less than 1%** of our population works in agriculture in the US, losing the culture of agriculture to a crtical mass of the US pop

### 1.3 Nature of Modern Agriculture

Today, agriculture is replaced with terms like "agribusiness" and other terms, signifying the **hyper-specialization of agriculture**. 

The average farmer does not worry about the whole scope, but rather being very good at growing one or two crops

### 1.4 Consequence of highly efficient modern aggriculture

Most of the agriculture advances that allowed us to have populations boom as big as it is now happend in the last 300-400 years, even more so in the last 100 years. 

Gas/Diesel powered equipment and the development of chemical fertilizer were major boosts in farming yield, although they came with consequences. 

10-12 calories of fuel energy is consumed to deliver one calorie of human nutrition, accounting for nearly 11% of greenhouse gas emissions in the US. 

Runoff rainfall that carries fertilizer with it carries to the sea, giving birth to an unhealthy amount of algae and depleting the waters of their oxygen.
