# Objectives
- To be able to explain how division of labor and trade have increased our standard of living
- To be able to explain the critical differences between the terms “standard of living” and “quality of life.”
- To be able to list ways the design of modern lifestyles has a negative impact on climate and to what extent.

# 1. Standard of Life vs Quality of Living

## 1.1 Hunter-Gatherers

As an example, hunter-gatherers are believed to have enjoyment in their life with good health. They had few possessions, but believed to have a **high** quality of life. 

Even with more leisure time than most people today enjoy, they're "standard of living" was very low

## 1.2 Modern Day

Since standard of living is defined by the availaibility of goods and services, techincally the US has a much higher stand of living.

Although this standard of living comes at a cost. A big one. It is not sustainable to have a high quality of life and a very high standard of living for most people. Thus, *their pursuit of a higher standard of living can lower their quality of life* 

## 1.3 Chase for the Higher Standard of Living

Humans went from a simple, self-sufficient way of life of building and sharing knowledge to maximizing "high standard of living"

# 2. What ends up happening for a higher standard of living

## 2.1 The tradeoffs

We know that the chemicals released into our environment can and have harmed people. So when does the positives of releasing these harmful pollutants into the air outweigh these negatives?

If it's never, then modern life cannot exist. 

## 2.2 Artificially low prices 

Since these polluting companies are exploiting labor most of the time and the pollutions costs are not paid by these companies (species extinction, medical costs), it allows for such low artificial prices
