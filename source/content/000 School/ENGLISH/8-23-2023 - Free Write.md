The most challenging parts of taking care of myself has been mainly being able to prioritize what I have to do on macro and micro scale. What I mean by this is, what do I have to on a week-by-week basis to be who I want to be in 6 months to a year from now. All my life I had neglected any sort of planning and it limited my potential, I am now allowing College to be a rebirth of sorts into a more productive version of myself that I knew was possible, but just left out of grasp due to something mundane as laziness. 

Three specific things I do is plan, plan, plan. I plan almost every part of my day in some. rough manner. This allows me to clearly know what I have time for and what I dont, maximizing my limited 24 hours in a day towards making myself a better person. I plan on achieving these goals by trusting the Yuvanesh that planned this out the Sunday prior and really sticking to what is planned for me without excuse.
