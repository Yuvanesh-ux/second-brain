I am doing pretty good so far, except for attendance, in all metrics that would define a succesful college student. And even attendance is only a problem when all your other grades fall as well, but this is not the case with me. However, I am still working on getting my attendance up but having to wake up at 8 or 7 am is really killing me after only getting to sleep at anywhere from 12-2 AM
