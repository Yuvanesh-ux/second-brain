Using Pathos, I would appeal to the human side of every parent that has already exhibited their ability to care for their child, why not just one more! Just this happens to be an animal, but many say that a dog is essentially family. The most likely way to apply ethos would be to cite other people that we know as a family that have dogs and are doing great, although they probably have a million examples of some random friend from their lifetime that got a dog and it turned it out to be a bad decision. Using Logos would be impossible because for my parents, it is not "logical" to have one more thing that siphons their income, time, care and wellbeing.
