A piece of media that I can still think about is what I've read/watched of the Walter Isaacson biography on Steve Jobs. It is so interesting to me what kind of a person he was and the kind of life he lived. He may seem like a cool, normal, and charismatic person when all you see him is through apple product keynotes and such, but he is far from that. He is an extremely weird, narcissistic and harsh individual. He was really into deep spiritual ways of life, so one time he stayed in India for a period of time to disconnect and learn more spiritual things. When he came, he brought very weird traditions back with him. For instance, Steve Jobs would bathe his feet in the Apple restrooms to destress. Yeah, he would DIP his FEET in TOILET WATER to DESTRESS. Insane, I know. And this was only one of many weird things he would do. The way he treated his employees was a very very very harsh version of tough love. Any mistakes would be followed up by ruthless and unapologetic slander and quiet compliments when success was achieved. I still think about this because it shows that you don't actually know anybody that you haven't met and talked to. No matter how big of fan or a fanatic you are of anyone, You have NO clue who they are and they definitely have no idea who you are.
