# How has the first day of class been so far? How are you feeling? Excited? Nervous? Overwhelmed?

First day of class has been pretty smooth. My MWF schedule is pretty top heavy starting with the gym at 6 AM and first class at 9AM. This is my last class of the day, so the second half of my day is pretty free for work and other things I want to do. Almost everyday ends around 2-3 PM at the latest. 

I am nervous, not for the first day of class, but for future classes when work really starts picking up and all the classes move on from the. "syllabus and icebreaker" stage towards the "get your work in and listen to what I have to say" phase. I am preparing for it by setting up a system of notes and time management to a level I never setup, nor really needed, in high school. These first few weeks will be insightful, at least, to see where the systems are breaking and what I can do proceed with the level of quality I am maintaining currently.
