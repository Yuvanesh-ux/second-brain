We started of with two technical questions. First was a 2D-DP problem and the second was a binary search problem

The problem was essentially Path with Maximum Gold on leetcode but instead you can only move from left to right (only moving forwards diagonally or just to the right)

This was decently difficult, I had explained the brute force solution and how time complexity would be O(3^n) and proceeded on the optimal solution.Â 

The first attempt I did was starting from the end and "accumulating" the gold backwards. He pointed out some problems in that approach but said "Starting from the end is on the right track," we talked through a bit and then I layed out a solution which was essentially a greedy approach, but he pointed why that wouldn't work, this time he didn't neccesarily mention that i was doing better but in hindsight this was also one step closer to the solution.Â 

Then he gave me the key insight of keep track of the best possible solution at any position with a seperate matrix. I proposed a solution that was a little better than his (same algorithm but didnt have to waste extra memory on a new grid by just editing the input grid). I coded it up, had to iterate once or twice to get it right. He had to ask some clarifying questions cause the interviewer wasn't familiar with python. He said it was good and we moved on.Â 

Before we did though he mentioned something about we might have to go a bit over time to be able to finish the interview.
  
Second question was exactly Search in Rotated Sorted Array. I knew exactly how to solve this problem because I'd probably solved it like a dozen times. I quickly showd the optimal approach, he asked some follow ups to make sure I knew it i think by presenting some edge cases. I was able to explain my algorithm and why it would cover those. Then proceeded to quickly coded up the solution and we were back on track in terms of timeÂ 

Now came the behavioral questions.Â 

The first questions was "Tell me about a time that you had to make a decision when the deadline was near" and "Tell me about a time you had to sacrifice something in the short term for the long term"

I had perfect stories prepared for both that I had run through with chatgpt earlier that day and they had all the LP attributes he was probably looking for and in the STAR format. He mentioned he was impressed with a project I had mentioned in the second question and said he would look into it after the interview (he had already been searching during the interview and had like a suprised face when he understood i was like a founder i guess of the project). I know that sounds like im bragging but I want to give complete context ðŸ˜­Â 

  

Then we talked about his life at amazon, what it was like as an intern. He was very excited to tell me, I showed some interested and I glazed him a bit.

  
**Final Outcome:** Rejected
