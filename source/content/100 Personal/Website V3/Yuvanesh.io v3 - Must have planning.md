# General Design Principles

Simple shapes and a max of 4 colors per color scheme, with one color scheme for each section
### Landing Page format

~~This section has to be the section where they can get the sparknotes of my whole life, 1-3 easy to scan paragraphs of **Where I work**, **What I'm working on**, **My level and insititue of education**, and any **literature** ~~

The above section has been removed. This is due to lack of simplicity and general unpleasantness in the format of the landing page layout. I want users to simply look and go, no more than 3 seconds to figure out what they have to do

MUST INCLUDE LANDING PAGE

###### Hi I'm Yuvanesh and I design... (switches between "LLMs", "UI/UX", "Backend architectures", and "probably whatever you're thinking of")

This section will be the primary things that the user will gravitate their eyes toward. There will also be a custom cursor, a circle that follows the true user cursor position with a bit of a lag to it. 

### Explore Page Format

This explore page will be the hub of my accomplishments

These accomplishments or pages will be split into cards, the discusion and organization of these cards will be liked [[Cards needed for Personal Website |here]]
